<p class="in0 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I Cannot</span>, without great Ingratitude,
forget the friendly
Visits and kind Advice I frequently
receiv'd from you, during,
not only, a dangerous
but tedious Indisposition, which surprisingly
seiz'd me in the Year 1717, and, notwithstanding
your extraordinary Care as well as
unquestionable Judgment, continu'd upon me
till the latter end of the Year &mdash;25; in
which long interval of Time, the Attendance
you gave me, and the Trouble you gave
yourself, abstracted from all Interest, made
you truly sensible of my unhappy Condition,
and myself equally apprehensive of the great
Obligations I shall ever be under to so sincere
a Friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first occasion of my Illness, as I
have good reason to imagine, was a very
shocking Surprize given me by certain Persons,
who pretended to be my Friends in a
considerable Affair then depending, wherein
their Treachery threaten'd me with succeeding
Ruin, had not Providence interpos'd and
deliver'd the Oppress'd from the cruel hands
of such deceitful Enemies: Upon whose
hard Usage, and the news of my Disappointment,
I was struck at first with a kind of
Epilepsy and depriv'd of all my Senses in an
Instant, drop'd down in a publick Coffee-House,
under violent Agitations, which, it
seems, are generally concomitant with this
miserable Distemper; but being luckily assisted
and kindly supported by some Gentlemen
present, I happen'd to escape those ill
Consequences that might otherwise have attended
me, during the extremity of my Convulsions,
which were reported, by those that
held me, to be so strong as to be almost insupportable,
till the Paroxism declin'd, which
terminated in a cold Sweat, Trembling and
Weeping, and this was the first Attack that
ever this terrible Assailant made upon me;
tho' afterwards he forc'd himself into a further
familiarity with me (much against my
Will) nor could your kind Endeavours, by
the Art of Physick, back'd with my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5</a></span>
strength of Constitution, fright away this
evil Companion from me, till my good Genius,
by the direction of Providence, communicated
a particular Secret to me, which,
with God's Blessing, has lately prov'd my
Deliverance, in what manner, before I conclude,
I shall very freely acquaint you, in
hopes you will favour me with your candid
Opinion in answer thereunto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> eight Years, was a long Time to
continue under the frequent returns and uncomfortable
dread of such a shocking Affliction,
which, upon every little disorder
of Mind or disappointment in Business, never
fail'd to visit me; till, by convulsive or
involuntary Motions in my Head and other
Parts of my Body, my Eyes were bury'd in
their Sockets, my other Features contracted,
my Limbs often distorted, my Bowels sometimes
wrack'd with intolerable Pains, and
all the Faculties of my Mind so greatly
weaken'd and impair'd, that I, who, for
many Years before, had been esteem'd as an
Oracle, by the most Polite and Curious part
of both Sexes, was now, for want of strength
of Mind and ability of Body to imploy my
Talent and excercise my Art as usual,
treated like an old Soldier, who had lost
his Limbs in the Service of his Country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6</a></span>
and thought only worthy, by way of requital,
to be made a hobbling Pensioner in some
starving Hospital; but, I thank my Stars,
it prov'd not quite so bad with me, for tho'
some Ladies were too hasty and importunate
to bear with the least disappointment or admit
of any delay, without shewing their resentment,
or refusing to trust their Money
till my Convulsions afforded me a rational
Interval, wherein I might be able to give
them ample Satisfaction: Yet, others, of a
more considerate, easy and compassionate
Temper, were so highly concern'd for my
too apparent Indisposition, that, in order to
drive out this tormenting Demon that possess'd
me, they brought me all the old Recipes
they could muster up among their
crazy Aunts and Grandmothers, practis'd
upon all Occasions in their several Families,
perhaps ever since the Times of <i>Galen</i> and
<i>Hippocrates</i>, but, having been long under
the Care and Friendship of so able a Physician
as your self, tho' to little or no purpose,
I could nor put Faith enough in old
Womens Medicines to receive Benefit thereby,
so, under a kind of despondency of every
thing but Providence, I suffer'd my Distemper
to take its own Course, till my Fits
encreas'd upon me, to at least twenty in a Day,
and by their frequent reiterations brought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7</a></span>
at length, such a dimness upon my Sight,
such a weakness in my Joints, and tremor
upon my Nerves, that render'd me incapable
of all manner of Business, especially that
which I had so long profess'd and successfully
perform'd, to the full Satisfaction and great
Astonishment of Thousands; but being now
unable to Write; and, for want of Speech,
having no other way of communicating my
Answers to the demands of the Ladies and
Gentlemen that apply'd themselves to me,
except by Digitation, which they understood
not, I was forc'd sometimes, when much
disorder'd by my Convulsions, to send 'em
away dissatisfy'd, which, if it were any
Mortification to them, prov'd a much greater
to my self, because, upon my ready performances
in the Mystery I am Master of,
depends the welfare of my whole Family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> these unhappy Circumstances I
labour'd till the Month of <i>October</i>, in the
Year &mdash;24, confin'd by my Distemper to my
own Habitation, not daring to go abroad
for fear of falling in the Streets, having
been before surpriz'd by my Fits in St. <i>James</i>'s
Park and several other Places; but, about
this Time, being possess'd with a strong Inclination
to the Cold-Bath, near Sir <i>John
Oldcastle</i>'s, and the great desire I had to experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"> 8</a></span>
the same, being highly encourag'd
by your Advice and Approbation, I summon'd
all the Strength I had to my Assistance,
and pursuant to the Dictates of my own restless
Mind, had recourse thither accordingly,
attended by a proper Person to take due
Care of me, for fear of the worst.</p>

<p>I had not repeated this cold Expedient
above twice or thrice, but I was sensible of
the Benefits I receiv'd thereby, for my Distemper
began to treat me with less severity
than usual, and my Fits were succeeded with
a greater Defluction of Tears than what was
common, before I apply'd my self to the Bath,
so that, after my Weeping was over, I found
my self much refresh'd and all my Faculties
abundantly more alert, than at any
Time they had been since my first Illness,
insomuch, that, from a timely continuance
of this external Application, I entertain'd
great hopes of a perfect Recovery; but,
notwithstanding my diligent Prosecution of
this sharp and shivering Method, I was, to
my great Sorrow, unhappily disappointed;
for my Convulsions were as frequent, tho'
not so violent as formerly, and I was now
again divested of all hopes of Relief, except
by the Hand of Providence, having nothing
to trust to, but that infallible Physician
who can Cure all things in an Instant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"> 9</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Despondency I was now under of
any Assistance from humane Art, and the
slender Opinion you seem'd to entertain of
my Recovery, made my Intervals as Melancholy
as my Fits were troublesome; oppress'd
with these hard Circumstances, I supported
a burthensome Life, and drag'd on
the tedious Hours till the latter end of the
Year &mdash;25, about which Time, as I was
slumbering one Morning in my Bed, after a
restless Night, my good <i>Genius</i> or Guardian
Angel, Cloth'd in a white Surplice like a
singing Boy, appear'd before me, holding a
Scrowle or Label in his right Hand, whereon
the following Words were wrote in large
Capitals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>READ, BELIEVE AND PRACTISE, THE
LOADSTONE SHALL BE YOUR CURE,
WITH AN ADDITION OF THE POWDER
HERE PRESCRIB'D YOU; BUT KEEP
THE LAST AS A SECRET; FOR WITH
THAT AND THE MAGNET YOU SHALL
RELIEVE NUMBERS IN DISTRESS,
AND LIVE TO DO GREATER WONDERS
THAN YOU HAVE HITHERTO
PERFORM'D; THEREFORE BE OF GOOD
CHEAR, FOR YOU HAVE A FRIEND UNKNOWN,
WHO, IN THE TIME OF TROUBLE,
WILL NEVER FAIL YOU.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"> 10</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> comfortable News, tho' deliver'd
to me after so surprizing a manner, yet,
was it very welcome to a languishing Person
under a complication of Misfortunes, notwithstanding
I had a great struggle with my
natural Reason, before I could convince my
self of what I was yet confident my very
Eyes had seen, or at least had been represented
to me after an extraordinary manner,
for betwixt really seeing what we call
a Vision or verily believing we do see it,
there is but a slender difference; however,
the intire Confidence I had put in Providence,
and the great desire I had to be reliev'd,
were to me convincing Arguments,
beyond all Objection, that my Guardian Angel
had actually appear'd and communicated
to my Eyes the very Scrowle that I had read,
the Words of which, lest my Memory should
have prov'd treacherous, I enter'd in my
Pocket-Book as they are before recited, the
Recipe only excepted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus subjected my Reason to
my Senses, or at least my Faith, for I either
saw or believ'd I saw what I have here reported,
I had nothing else to do, but to put
in Practice the Receipt which my good <i>Genius</i>
had imparted to me, tho' how to come at a
Loadstone, seem'd to me as difficult as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"> 11</a></span>
find out the Philosopher's Stone, having but
a slender Knowledge of the thing it self, and
much less of its Virtues; however, upon
enquiry, I soon found out a certain Virtuoso,
near <i>Moorfields</i>, who is an eminent dealer
in such sort of Curiosities, and by his Assistance
I presently furnish'd my self with
what I wanted, and sending for some fat
Amber and a certain preparation of Steel,
which I privately dispens'd in a very particular
manner, according to the <i>Recipe</i> communicated
by my <i>Genius</i>; then applying both
as directed, was miraculously deliver'd, in a
great measure, from those wracking Convulsions
which had so long afflicted me, and
in less than a Month's Time my whole Microcosm
was restor'd to such a happy State
of Health, Strength and Vivacity, that
Heaven be prais'd, I could do any thing as
usual, but, if I leave off my Loadstone for
two or three Days, which I have sometimes
done, meerly out of Curiosity, my Fits, as
yet, will remind me of my foolish Presumption,
and force me to have recourse to my
wonderful Preservative, which has not only
prov'd so great a friend to my self, but has
reliev'd others in the like distress; and as I
have found by three or four late Experiments,
is as effectual in suppresing Vapours
and removing or preventing Hysterick Fits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"> 12</a></span>
in Women, as it is in Epilepsies and Convulsions
in our own Sex, either Men or Children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span>, Doctor, since I have happily conquer'd
so stubborn an Enemy, by such miraculous
means, as do not fail to afflict others as well
as my self, I desire you will vouchsafe me
your real Sentiments of this uncommon way
of Cure, your Notions of the <i>Genii</i>, and the
wonderful manner of communicating the
<i>Recipe</i>, your Thoughts of the Loadstone
and the Virtues thereof, your Opinion of
Sympathy and the Cures perform'd thereby,
for I know you are Philosopher sufficient, as
well as Physician, to give a very good light
into all these Mysteries, in which I own I
am to seek; therefore hope you will condescend
so far as to spend a leisure Hour upon
the foregoing Particulars, and you will
infinitely oblige,</p>

</div>

<p class="sigleft"><i>SIR</i>,</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">I</span> <span class="smcap">Receiv'd</span> your Letter and read the
same, with no less Surprise than Satisfaction;
for, as I am greatly pleas'd at your
miraculous Recovery, so, I am equally astonish'd
at the wonderful Means by which it
was obtain'd; I confess, I have been too
great a Student in Physick and natural Philosophy,
to entertain any extraordinary Opinion
of Miracles, no ways accountable to
human Reason, except those that concern
Religion, which are brought down to our
Knowledge well attested and recommended
to our Faith by unexceptionable Authorities;
not, but, that I am ready to admit, that the
Power of Healing is in the Hand of Providence,
and that some Patients, when their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"> 14</a></span>
Distempers, thro' the frailty of humane
Judgment, derive their Essence from so obscure
an Original that even puzzles the Physician,
I am free to acknowledge, especially
when the Blessing of God accompanies the
Administration, that the most trifling application
in the Eyes of Art, may recover
such Persons from the most dangerous Infirmities:
This, I look upon to be your extraordinary
Case, and therefore think not the
means to which you ascribe your Cure or
the manner of the <i>Recipe</i>'s being communicated
to you, a proper subject for a Physical
Enquiry, unless you had sent me the Prescription
of your <i>Genius</i>, which I understand
by your Letter, you are oblig'd to conceal,
and then perhaps I should have been
able to have judg'd, in some measure, which
of the Applications are most Essential, the
Powder or the Loadstone, also how far your
Guardian Angel is a Regular Proficient in
the modern Practise of Physick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span>, as you desire my Opinion of
the <i>Genii</i>, the Loadstone, the Powder of
Sympathy, and the like, I shall not be only
willing to give you my own Thoughts, but
the Sentiments of others, before I take my
leave, who have made the foregoing Particulars
their principal Studies, and are therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"> 15</a></span>
better acquainted with the nature of
Spirits, than I pretend to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for <i>Genii</i> or familiar Spirits, good and
bad, believ'd and reported, by the most Wise
and Learned of the Ancients, to attend Mankind,
and the various Operations they have
had upon humane Minds as well as Bodies,
I cannot but confess, seem very wonderful
to my defective Understanding; yet, when
we observe what innumerable Instances have
been handed to us by the most reputable Authors,
both Antique and Modern, attested
from Time to Time by unquestionable Authorities,
who, that, before he div'd into
these Mysteries, look'd upon the same to be
Whimsy, can forbear staggering in his Opinion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most celebrated Instance of a <i>Genius</i>
among the Ancients, is that of <i>Socrates</i>,
one of the wisest of the Philosophers in the
Age he liv'd in, and that he had such a familiar
Spirit to attend him, which the <i>Greeks</i>
call'd <i>D&#230;mon</i>, and the <i>Latins Genius</i>, is
sufficiently testify'd by three of his Contemporaries,
<i>viz.</i> <i>Plato</i>, <i>Xenophon</i> and <i>Antisthenes</i>,
also further confirm'd by <i>Laertius</i>,
<i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Maximus Tyrius</i>, <i>Dion</i>, <i>Chrysostomus</i>,
<i>Cicero</i>, <i>Apuleius</i>, and <i>Facinas</i>; besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16</a></span>
others more Modern, as, <i>Tertullian</i>, <i>Origen</i>,
<i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, &amp;c. but that which
is of greater Authority than all the Vouchers
aforemention'd, is what <i>Socrates</i> says of
himself, in <i>Plato's Theage</i>, viz. <i>By some Divine
Lot, I have a certain</i> D&#230;mon, <i>which
has follow'd me from my Childhood, as an
Oracle</i>; <i>and this Voice</i>, says he, for so he
terms it, <i>whenever it speaks to me, disswades
me from engaging in what I am about to put
in Action, but never prompts me to attempt
any thing</i>. This, I presume, might be the
chief Reason, why <i>Socrates</i> persu'd not his
own Inclinations, which were naturally Vicious,
as himself confess'd to the Physiognomist,
but was always accompany'd with a
divine Spirit that restrain'd him from it;
for, in speaking to <i>Alcibiades</i>, a vicious Noble
Man of <i>Athens</i>, but reclaim'd by <i>Socrates</i>;
says he, <i>My Tutor</i> (meaning the Spirit
that attended him) <i>is wiser and better than
you</i>. And to further shew, that what he call'd
his <i>D&#230;mon</i>, was something more than a
secret Impulse of the Mind, or Dictates of a
good Conscience, <i>Theocritus</i> affirms in <i>Plutarch</i>,
that a Vision attended <i>Socrates</i> from
his Childhood, going before him and guiding
him in all the Actions of his Life, being
a constant light to him in such Affairs
as lay not within the reach of humane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17</a></span>
standing, and that the Spirit often spoke to
him, divinely governing and inspiring his Intentions.
A thousand Instances of the like nature,
I could collect from the Ancients, to
prove, that what you have reported to me, in
your Letter, may be no Delusion, but real
Fact, with all it's surprising Circumstances,
could the Task be compris'd within the compass
of a Letter, but, a Treatise of this nature,
being much fitter for a Volume, I shall
only proceed to a few familiar Instances of a
more modern Date, that your wonderful Cure
may gain Credit with the Publick, because I
know your Sincerity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Froissard</span> reports, That in the Time of
<i>Edward</i> the Third, there was a certain
Knight in <i>France</i>, call'd <i>Corasse</i>, who could
tell every thing Transacted throughout the
whole World, in a Day or two at the most,
were the distance never so remote, and this
he did by an invisible Intelligencer or familiar
Spirit, which he call'd <i>Orthone</i>, who was
always at his Command and brought him
News continually for many Years, till, at
last, he lost the Benefit of so useful a Companion,
through a vain desire of gratifying his
Curiousity after the following manner, (<i>viz.</i>)
The Knight, having hitherto only heard the
Voice of his spiritual Emissary, was now infatuated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18</a></span>
with an earnest inclination to behold
his Shapes, which favour he requested of <i>Orthone</i>;
accordingly, whose Answer was, that
the first thing he should see on the morrow
Morning, after he was risen from his Bed,
should be the Object he desir'd, or Words to
that effect. The Knight, the next Morning,
pursuant to the direction of his Spirit, arose
from his Bed, look'd about him, but could not
discover any thing worthy of Remark; upon
which disappointment, he upbraided <i>Orthone</i>,
with being worse than his Word, who reply'd
he had kept his Promise, desiring the Knight
to remind himself of what he had first observ'd
after his rising; the Knight, upon recollection,
reply'd, that he saw nothing uncommon,
but a couple of Straws tumbling upon
the Ground and sporting with one another,
as if agitated by the Wind; <i>That was I</i>, saith
the Spirit, <i>and therefore I kept my Word</i>.
Then the Knight desir'd to see him once more,
in such a Shape as might induce him, the next
Time, to take more notice of him, to which the
Spirit consented, saying, <i>the first thing you see
to morrow Morning, after your uprising, shall
be me again</i>; accordingly, when the Time appointed
was arriv'd and the Knight was risen
from his Bed, looking out of his Chamber
Window, the first Object he espy'd, was a
Lean ill-favour'd Sow, so deform'd and ugly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19</a></span>
that he was not able to abide the sight of her;
and not expecting <i>Orthone</i> to appear to him in
so homely a manner, he set his Dogs upon
the Sow, to drive her away, who being highly
affronted at such unfriendly usage, immediately
Vanish'd, to the Knight's great surprise;
and his old acquaintance <i>Orthone</i>, never came
near him after. This relation, <i>Froissard</i> asserts
he had from the Knight's own Mouth,
with whom he was very intimate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> hence I conclude, That the same
sort of Spirit that attended <i>Corasse</i>, has been
always a Friend to you, not only of late, in
your miraculous Recovery, but has at all
Times assisted you in Writing the Names of
Strangers, discovering the most secret Intrigues
and foretelling future Events, for
which you have long been Famous. As a further
Proof of the Existence of Spirits and that
at some other Times, as well as in your Case,
they have prescrib'd Physick to their living
Friends, I shall quote an Instance out of Mr.
<i>Glanvil</i>'s <i>Reports</i>, attested by the late Lord
<i>Orrery</i>, the Famous Mr. <i>Greatrix</i>, and many
others, living in the Reign of King <i>Charles</i>
the Second.</p>

<p>A Gentleman in <i>Ireland</i>, near to the Earl
of <i>Orrery</i>'s House, sending his Butler one Afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20</a></span>
to a neighbouring Village to buy Cards,
as he pass'd a Field, espy'd a Company in the
middle thereof, sitting round a Table, with
several Dishes of good Cheer before them,
and moving towards 'em, they all arose and Saluted
him, desiring him to sit down and take
part with them; but one of them whisper'd
these Words in his Ear, <i>viz.</i> <i>Do nothing this
Company invites you to</i>: Whereupon, he refusing
to accept of their Kindness, the Table
and all the Dainties it was furnish'd with
immediately vanish'd, but the Company fell
to Dancing and playing upon divers Musical
Instruments, the Butler being a second Time
solicited to partake of their Diversions, but
would not be prevail'd upon to engage himself
with them; upon which, they left off
their Merry-making and all fell to Work,
still pressing the Butler to make one among
'em, but to no purpose; so that, upon his
third refusal, they all vanish'd and left the
Butler alone, who in a great Consternation
return'd home, without the Cards, fell into
a Fit as he enter'd the House, but, soon recovering
his Senses, related to his Master all
that had pass'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Night, one of the Ghostly
Company came to the Butler's Bed-side and
told him, that if he offer'd to stir out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21</a></span>
next Day, he would be carry'd away; upon
whose Advice, he kept within till towards
the Evening, and having then an Occasion
to make Water, ventur'd to set one Foot over
the Threshold of the Door, in order to ease
himself, which he had no sooner done, but
a Rope was cast about his Middle, in the
Sight of several Standers-by, and the poor
Man was hurry'd from the Porch with unaccountable
Swiftness, follow'd by many Persons,
but they were not nimble enough to
overtake him, till a Horseman, well mounted,
happening to meet him upon the Road,
and seeing many followers in pursuit of a
Man hurry'd along in a Rope, without any
Body to force him, catch'd hold of the Cord
and stop'd him in his Career, but receiv'd,
for his Pains, such a strap upon his Back
with one End of the Rope, as almost fell'd
him from his Horse; however, being a good
Christian, he was too strong for the Devil,
and recover'd the Butler out of the Spirits
Clutches and brought him back to his
Friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lord <i>Orrery</i>, hearing of these
strange Passages, for his further Satisfaction
in the Truth thereof, sent for the Butler,
with leave of his Master, to come and
continue some Days and Nights at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22</a></span>
House, which, in Obedience to his Lordship,
the Servant did accordingly, who after
his first Night's Bedding there, reported
to the Earl in the Morning, that his Spectre
had again been with him, and assur'd him,
that on that very Day he should be spirited
away, in spight of all the Measures
that could possibly be taken to prevent it:
Upon which, he was conducted into a large
Room, with a considerable Number of holy
Persons to defend him from the Assaults
of Satan; among whom, was the famous
stroker of bewitch'd Persons, Mr. <i>Greatrix</i>,
who liv'd in the Neighbourhood, and knew,
as may be presum'd, how to deal with the
Devil as well as any Body; besides several
eminent Quality were present in the House,
among the rest, two Bishops, all waiting
the wonderful Event of this unaccountable
Prodigy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Till</span> part of the Afternoon was spent,
the Time slid away in nothing but Peace
and Quietness, but, at length, the enchanted
Patient was perceiv'd to rise from the
Floor without any visible Assistance, whereupon,
Mr. <i>Greatrix</i> and another lusty Man
clapt their Arms over his Shoulders, and
endeavour'd to weigh him down with their
utmost Strength, but to no purpose, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"> 23</a></span>
Devil prov'd too powerful, and after a hard
struggle on both sides, made them quit
their hold, and snatching the Butler from
'em, carry'd him over their Heads and
toss'd him in the Air, to and fro, like a
Dog in a Blanket; several of the Company
running under the poor Wretch to save him
from the Ground, by which means, when the
Spirits Frolick was over, they could not
find that in all this hurry-scurry, the
frighted Butler had receiv'd the least Damage,
but was left in <i>Statu quo</i>, upon the
same Premises, to prove the Devil a Liar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Goblins, for this bout, having
given over their Pastime, and left their
Maygame to take a little repose, that he
might in some Measure be refresh'd against
their next Sally, My Lord order'd, the
same Night, two of his Servants to lie with
him, for fear some Devil or other should
come and catch him Napping, notwithstanding
which, the Butler told his Lordship
the next Morning, that the Spirit had
again been with him in the likeness of a
Quack Doctor, and in his right Hand a
wooden Dish-full of grey Liquor, like a Mess
of Porridge, at sight of which, he endeavour'd
to awake his Bedfellows, but the
Spectre told him his attempts were fruitless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"> 24</a></span>
for that his Companions were enchanted
into a deep Sleep, advising him not to be
frighted, for he came as a Friend, and was
the same Spirit that caution'd him in the
Field against complying with the Company
he there met, when he was going for
the Cards; adding, that if he had not refus'd
to come into their Measures, he had
been for ever miserable; also wonder'd he
had escap'd the Day before, because he
knew there was so powerful a Combination
against him; but assur'd him, that for the
future there would be no more attempts of
the like Nature; further telling the poor
trembling Butler, that he knew he was sadly
troubl'd with two sorts of Fits, and,
therefore, as a Friend, had brought him a
Medicine that would Cure him of both, beseeching
him to take it, but the poor Patient,
who had been so scurvily us'd by
these sort of Doctors, and fearing the Devil
might be at the Bottom of the Cup, would
not be prevail'd upon to swallow the Dose,
which made the Spirit Angry; who told
him, however, he had a kindness for him,
and that if he would bruise the Roots of
Plantane without the Leaves, and drink the
the Juice thereof, it should certainly Cure
him of one sort of his Fits, but as a Punishment
for his Obstinacy in refusing the Liquor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"> 25</a></span>
he should carry the other to his Grave,
then the spiritual Doctor ask'd his Patient
if he knew him; the Butler answer'd, <i>No</i>.
<i>I am</i>, says he, <i>the wandring Ghost of your old
Acquaintance</i> John Hobby, <i>who has been
dead and bury'd these seven Years</i>; <i>and ever
since, for the wickedness of my Life, have
been lifted into the Company of those Evil-Spirits
you beheld in the Fields, am hurry'd
up and down in this restless Condition, and
doom'd to continue in the same wretched State
till the Day of Judgment</i>. Adding, that
<i>Had you serv'd your Creator in the days of
your Youth, and offer'd up your Prayers that
Morning, before you were sent for the Cards,
you had not been treated by the Spirits that
tormented you, with so much Rigour and Severity</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the Butler had reported these
marvellous Passages to my Lord and his Family,
the two Bishops, that were present, among
other Quality, were thereupon consulted,
whether or no, it was proper for
the Butler to follow the Spirit's Advice, in
taking Plantane Juice for the Cure of his
Fits, and whether he had done well or ill,
in refusing the Liquid Dose which the
Spectre would have given him; the Question,
at first, seem'd to be a kind of moot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"> 26</a></span>
Point, but, after some struggle in the Debate,
their Resolution was, that the Butler
had acted, through the whole Affair, like
a good Christian, for that it was highly
sinful to follow the Devil's Advice in any
thing, and that no Man should do Evil that
Good might come of it; so that, in short,
the poor Butler, after all his Fatigue, had
no amends for his trouble, but was deny'd,
by the Bishops, the seeming Benefit that the
Spirit intended him.</p>

<p>I do not introduce this old surprising
Story to amuse you, but to let you know, that
it is no new thing for Spectres to turn
Doctors to such ailing Persons as they retain
a Respect for, and that your <i>Genius</i>
was not the first Spirit that ever practis'd
Physick; therefore, if this Narrative reported
by <i>Glanvil</i>, <i>Beaumont</i>, and others, may
obtain Credit, upon the Authorities of my
Lord <i>Orrery</i>, Mr. <i>Greatrix</i>, and divers
Persons, who were in a great measure Eye-Witnesses
of the matter, I see no Reason I
have to doubt the Truth of your Letter,
since I know your Integrity; besides, it has
always been allow'd by such D&#230;monologers
as have Publish'd their Thoughts upon the
visibility of Spirits, that <i>Scotland</i>, is never
without such a sort of People as they call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"> 27</a></span>
Second-sighted, who have not only the
Power of discerning Apparitions, but, by
their frequent Conversation with Spirits,
foretel future Events, to the great Astonishment
of all Persons that consult them:
That there are such sort of Diviners in the
World, especially in <i>Scotland</i>, I am throughly
convinc'd; of which Number I take your
self to be one, but how to account for your
mysterious Performances, I readily confess,
I know not, and therefore shall submit that
Task to such as are qualify'd with a more
subtil Penetration.</p>

<p>I doubt I have tir'd your Patience with
too much Prolixity upon familiar Spirits,
therefore, to make you amends, I will be
but short in my Dissertation upon the Loadstone;
which in the first place, is, a very
ponderous Fossile, found in different Climates,
and seems in its Nature and Qualities to be
nearly related to Iron Oar, from whence it
is endow'd with a peculiar property of drawing
Iron to its self by the Power of Sympathy,
or the natural Disposition it has to
Embrace that particular Metal. In <i>&#198;gypt</i>
there are large Mines of it, some few Magnets
have been found in <i>&#198;thiopia</i>, which
have attracted Iron very forcibly; but two
sorts are dug up at the foot of the <i>Sardinian</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"> 28</a></span>
Mountains, of such different Natures, that as
one draws Iron, the other will repel it; as
you will find it reported by <i>Johannes Jonstonus</i>,
in his History of <i>Nature</i>, also by
<i>Pliny</i>, in his Second Book, who, for the aforesaid
Reason, calls this Stone <i>Theamedes</i>:
As to the singular Virtues hitherto discover'd
in the common Loadstone, the most admirable
of all are the strict Correspondence it
maintains with the two Poles, and the
wonderful Property it communicates, by a
touch, to the Needle, for the Benefit of
Mariners. The Power of its Attraction,
is thought by some Virtuosos to be owing
to a clammy bituminous Substance, by
which the Contexture of the more solid
Parts are closely semented and confirm'd; to
prove this, work a Loadstone in the Fire
and it shall cast forth a blewish Flame,
like that of lighted Brimstone, and so continue,
till it spends its Life and loses the
Power of Attraction. There is a great
deal of Sulphur in Iron as well as in
the Loadstone, which is the principal Cause
of their Sympathising with each other,
and if you destroy the first in either, the
last will fail in course, which is the Reason,
why the Loadstone will not attract
the Rust of Iron, tho' it will the Filings, because
in the former, the bituminous Matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"> 29</a></span>
is quite spent and nothing left but a
kind of <i>Caput mortuum</i>. The Loadstone
hath also two Poles, which answer those in
the Heavens, if you touch the Needle with
the North Pole of the Stone, it will point
to the Artick, if with the South part thereof,
as it stood posited in the Mine, it
will point to the Antartick, but not with
the utmost exactness, except it stands in
the Meridian: But to be further satisfy'd in
these Mysteries, have recourse to <i>Libavius</i>,
<i>Cardanus</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Bodin</i>, <i>Porta</i>, our own
<i>Philosophical Transactions</i>, and such Authors
as have treated more largely upon this
Subject: for, I suppose, all that you want
to know of me is, if ever I have heard from
others, or discover'd by my own Experience,
any such Physical Virtue in the Loadstone,
as may tend to the Cure of any Chronical
or other Disease incident to humane Bodies,
that may strengthen the Opinion you seem
to entertain of it in such Cases, from the
Benefit your self has lately receiv'd in so
extraordinary a manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> answer to this, I confess, I have
heard it affirm'd (but not by a Physician)
that the Loadstone hath withdrawn the Inflamation
and given Ease in the Gout, and
by changing the Application of it from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"> 30</a></span>
side to the other, has at length chas'd it
away, to the perfect recovery of the Patient;
but in any other Case, excepting your own,
I never heard of a Cure so much as facilitated
or attempted to be perform'd thereby;
therefore, as the Use of it in any Disease
is quite Foreign to the common
Practice of Physick, if others, as well as
your self, have receiv'd Benefit by this new
Discovery, I think not my self oblig'd to
account for it, till it becomes practical
among my own Fraternity, and then it
will be Time enough for any Physician
to give his Thoughts thereon; besides, I
am a Stranger to the Preparation prescrib'd
to you by your <i>Genius</i>, and without the
knowledge of that material Secret, it is
impossible for any Physician, in your Case,
to make a clear Judgment, or to know
which of the two your Cure is chiefly
owing to, the Powder or the Loadstone;
for how far the latter may operate upon
a Body prepar'd by <i>Pulvis Martis</i> or
other Chalybeates, I shall not pretend to
determine, tho', for ought I know, wonderful
Cures may be perform'd in that way,
but upon what Reason in Nature, such a
new System can be founded, seems very remote
from my present understanding; but,
since you are become sole Master of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"> 31</a></span>
wonderful a Secret, my Advice is, that
you keep the <i>Recipe</i> to your self, in Obedience
to your <i>Genius</i>, and tho' you Assist
others, never to do it without Fee or Reward,
for all useful Discoveries ought to be
render'd Profitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> answer to the last Article of your
Request, I shall now proceed to say something
of Sympathy, and the Cures reported
to have been done thereby. The Sympathetick
Powder, so highly esteem'd about
a hundred Years since, by Men of
Art in this Kingdom, was first brought into
<i>Europe</i> by a Religious <i>Carmelite</i>, who
in his Travels thro' <i>India</i>, <i>Persia</i>, and
<i>China</i>, had made himself Master of this
Secret, and from some of those <i>Eastern</i>
Countries, came over into <i>Tuscany</i>, where
he perform'd many considerable Cures by
this occult Method, to the great Astonishment
of the most eminent Physicians and
Surgeons in those Parts; insomuch that the
Duke of <i>Tuscany</i> himself was very desirous
of becoming Master of this surprizing <i>Arcanum</i>,
but, the honest Fryar by many
handsome Excuses brought himself off,
and would not be prevail'd upon to communicate
his <i>Nostrum</i> to his Highness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"> 32</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> few Months after this, our Famous
<i>English</i> Virtuoso, Sir <i>Kenelm Digby</i>,
happening in his Travels to be at the
Grand Duke's Court, an Opportunity fell
accidentally in the Knight's way to do
the Fryar a Service, which the good old
Man took so kindly at his hands, that
he recompenc'd the Curtesy with a Discovery
of his Secret; and soon after returning
into <i>Persia</i>, left no Man in <i>Europe</i> Master
of the same but Sir <i>Kenelm</i>, who
was the first Person that brought the <i>Recipe</i>
into <i>England</i>, and that here wrought
Cures by it himself, and recommended it
to the Practice of others; so that, in a
little Time, every Mother-Midwife, and
Country Fleabeard, became topping Surgeons,
especially for the Cure of Green-Wounds;
for it is not to be trusted to,
in other Cases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Sympathetick Powder, by which
many Miracles have been perform'd at
great Distances, is nothing more than the
Simple Powder of <i>Roman Vitriol</i>, either
Chymically prepar'd, or imperfectly calcin'd
in the Beams of the Sun; from
whence, 'tis said, it derives a very balsamick
Virtue; a little of this apply'd to
any Instrument that has done Mischief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"> 33</a></span>
or to a Rag dip'd into, or stain'd with,
the Blood of a Wound, never fails of
Curing the Patient at the widest Distance,
provided the Wound be Curable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span> <i>Kenelm Digby</i>, to advance the Credit
of this surprising Medicine, speaks very
largely in Commendation thereof, in a
little Treatise of his, written first in
<i>French</i>, upon the same Subject; wherein
he boasts of a remarkable Cure perform'd
by himself, in a most wonderful manner,
with only the use of this astonishing Powder;
and, therefore, as in religious Cases,
Example goes beyond Precept, so, to convince
you of the Miracles perform'd by
Sympathy, Instances, perhaps, may prove
more effectual than Arguments; for which
Reason, I shall proceed to furnish you
with a notable Experiment of this Magical
Powder, and so conclude.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <i>James Howel</i>, a trusty Servant
to King <i>James</i> the First, famous in those
Days for Compiling a Treatise, entitled
<i>Dendrologia</i>, and afterwards for his Legacy
to the World, call'd, <i>Epistoli&#230; Ho-Elian&#230;</i>,
happen'd, when he was a Young
Gentleman, to accidently come by, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"> 34</a></span>
two of his dearest Friends were fiercely
Engag'd in a very dangerous Duel, and
to prevent the Mischief very likely to
ensue, too rashly catch'd hold, with his
naked Hand, of his Sword, whose Passion
prompted him to be the most desperate;
in which attempt, the Weapon, being
drawn through Mr. <i>Howel</i>'s Palm, cut
the Nerves and Muscles thereof to the
very Bone, and, as they were thus Scuffling,
holding up the same Hand to defend
one of his Friends from a Blow
upon his Head, receiv'd another cut upon
the back of his Hand, cross all the
Veins and Tendons, more terrible than
the former, which, his Friends perceiving,
put a sudden stop to their inebrious Fury,
run both to embrace him and to express
their sorrow for the unhappy Accident,
lending him their Assistance to bind up his
Wounds with one of his own Garters, and
so conducted him to his Lodgings, where
they sent immediately for a Surgeon,
who found the Case desperate, for he
bled abundantly.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <i>Howel</i>, being a Gentleman much
respected by the Quality, the News of
his Misfortune soon reach'd the Court;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"> 35</a></span>
and his Majesty, having, also, a great
regard for him, sent one of his own
Surgeons to attend him, who found the
Case to be so very bad that he seem'd
doubtful of a Cure, without cutting off
his Hand, which occasion'd Mr. <i>Howel</i>,
about five Days after the Hurt receiv'd,
to apply himself to his good Friend and
Neighbour, Sir <i>Kenelm Digby</i>, who, at
that Time was famous for the Sympathetick-Powder,
begging his Assistance in
that painful Extremity, telling him, that
his Surgeons were apprehensive of a
Gangrene.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span> <i>Kenelm</i>, opening the Wounds,
found a terrible Case of it, and a dangerous
Inflamation upon the Part, which, Mr.
<i>Howel</i> acknowledg'd, gave him such intolerable
Pain as was scarce supportable;
the Knight, ask'd him, if he had any
Bandage with the Blood upon it, Mr.
<i>Howel</i> answer'd, <i>Yes</i>; accordingly sent
his Servant for the bloody Garter which
had first bound up his Wounds, and deliver'd
it to Sir <i>Kenelm</i>, who, calling
for a Bason of Water, went into his
Closet for a handful of his Powder,
which he infus'd therein, and then soak'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36</a></span>
the Garter in the same Liquor; whilst
Mr. <i>Howel</i> was talking with another
Gentleman, at the further End of the
Room, not knowing in the least what
Sir <i>Kenelm</i> was doing, who, after he
had bath'd the Garter in the Bason about
a Minute, call'd to his Patient and
ask'd him how he found himself, who
answer'd, <i>So wonderful Easy that the
Inflamation seems to be totally Extinguish'd,
the Pain quite gone off, and my
Hand I find as cool and as much refresh'd,
as if it was wrap'd up in a wet
Napkin</i>. <i>Then</i>, reply'd the Knight, <i>fling
off your Dressings, meddle no more with
Plasters, only keep your Wounds clean
and from the Air, and I doubt not, but
in a few Days Time, I shall effectually
Cure you, without putting you to any further
Trouble</i>. Much Comforted with this
Assurance, Mr. <i>Howel</i> took a thankful
Leave of Sir <i>Kenelm</i>, and so departed.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <i>Howel</i>, had not been gone above
a Quarter of an Hour, but the Knight took
the Garter out of the Liquor, to dry it
before the Fire, and carelesly hanging
it a little too near, the extraordinary
Heat, by the Concatination of Effluvia's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"> 37</a></span>
had such an Effect upon the Patient,
that he made as many wry Faces as a
Cook that had burnt his Fingers; dispatching
his Servant, with all imaginable
Expedition, to let his Doctor know what
a Condition he was relaps'd into.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span> <i>Kenelm</i>, who presently conjectur'd
the Cause of this Disaster, smiling at the
Message the Servant had deliver'd, and
snatching the Garter from the Fire, told
him, that his Master should be very
Easy by the Time he could return to
him, which the Footman, by the acknowledgment
of his Master, found to
be true accordingly; Sir <i>Kenelm</i>, doing
nothing more to work this change, than
cooling the wreaking Garter by a speedy
Repetition of his former Application;
so that, without any further Accident
interposing, the Patient was thoroughly
cur'd, in five or six Days Time, by
this extraordinary Method, to the inexpressible
Admiration of all his Majesty's
Surgeons."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
